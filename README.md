# Rails & React Recipes

![App Demo](app/assets/images/screenshot.png)

In this project I:

- Created a Rails Application correctly;
- Configured a React App to display the frontend;
- Created a Recipe Model with the corresponding controller;
- Configured the routes correctly both on Rails and React;
- Connected the React components with the Rails API to view, create and delete Recipes.

# What it does?

- When the App is executed, you will be able to:

  - Get a list of all Recipes created;
  - Create new Recipes;
  - View a single Recipe;
  - Delete a Recipe.
